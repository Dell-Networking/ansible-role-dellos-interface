 Interface Role for Dell EMC Networking OS
=========================================

This role facilitates the configuration of interface attributes. It supports the configuration of admin state, description, MTU, IP address, IP helper, suppress_ra and port mode.
This role is abstracted for dellos9, dellos6 and dellos10.

Installation
------------

```
ansible-galaxy install Dell-Networking.dellos-interface
```

Requirements
------------

This role requires an SSH connection for connectivity to your Dell EMC Networking device. You can use any of the built-in Dell EMC Networking OS connection variables, or the ``provider``
dictionary.

Role Variables
--------------

This role is abstracted using the variable ``ansible_net_os_name`` that can take the following values: dellos9, dellos6, dellos10.

Any role variable with a corresponding state variable setting to absent negates the configuration of that variable. 
For variables with no state variable, setting an empty value for the variable negates the corresponding configuration.
The variables and its values are case-sensitive.

``dellos_interface`` (dictionary) holds a dictionary with the interface name. The interface name can correspond to any of the valid OS interfaces with the unique interface identifier name.

For physical interfaces, the interface name must be in the format `<interfacename> <tuple>`. For logical interfaces, the format is `<logical_interfacename> <id>`.
For example, the physical interface name can be in the format fortyGigE 1/1 for dellos9 devices, ethernet 1/1/32 for dellos10 devices and Te1/0/1 for dellos6 devices.
The logical interface names can be in the format vlan 1 or port-channel 12 for dellos9 devices, dellos6 devices and dellos10 devices.

```
Note: Only define supported variables for the interface type. For example, do not define the ``switchport`` variable for a logical interface; do not configure portmode when ``switchport`` is present in dellos9 devices; do not define ip address for physical interfaces in dellos6 devices.
```


``interface name`` holds the following keys:

|        Key | Type                      | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Connection Variables
--------------------

Ansible Dell EMC Networking roles require the following connection information to establish 
communication with the nodes in your inventory. This information can exist in
the Ansible group_vars or host_vars directories, or in the playbook itself.


|         Key | Required | Choices    | Description                              |
| ----------: | -------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
|        host | yes      |            | Hostname or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified ``transport``. The value of this key is the destination address for the transport. |
|        port | no       |            | Port used to build the connection to the remote device. If this key does not specify the value, the value defaults to 22. |
|    username | no       |            | Configures the username that authenticates the connection to the remote device. The value of this key authenticates the CLI login. If this key does not specify the value, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME is used instead. |
|    password | no       |            | Specifies the password that authenticates the connection to the remote device. If this key does not specify the value, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD is used instead. |
|   authorize | no       | yes, no*   | Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If this key does not specify the value, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE is used instead. If not specified, the device attempts to execute all commands in non-privileged mode.|
|   auth_pass | no       |            | Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If this key is set to no, then this argument not applicable. If the ``auth_pass`` does not specify the value, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS is used instead. |
|   transport | yes      | cli*       | Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device. This key supports connectivity to the device over CLI (SSH).  |
|    provider | no       |            | Convenient method that passes all of the above connection arguments as a dictonary object. All constraints (such as required or choices) must be met either by individual arguments or values in this dictonary. |

```
Note: Asterisk (*) denotes the default value if none is specified.
```

Dependencies
------------

The Dell-Networking.dellos-interface role is built on modules included in the core Ansible code.
These modules were added in Ansible version 2.2.0.


Example Playbook
----------------
The following example uses the Dell-Networking.dellos-interface role to set up description, MTU, admin status, portmode, and switchport details for an interface. This example creates a ``hosts`` file with the switch, a corresponding ``host_vars`` file, and then a simple playbook that references the dellos-interface role.

Sample ``hosts`` file:

    leaf3 ansible_host= <ip_address> ansible_net_os_name= <OS name(dellos9/dellos6/dellos10)>

Sample ``host_vars/leaf3``:
    
	hostname: "leaf3"
    provider:
        host: "{{ hostname }}"
        username: xxxxx
        password: xxxxx
        authorize: yes
        auth_pass: xxxxx 
        transport: cli
